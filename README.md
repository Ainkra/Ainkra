# About Ainkra ‚ú®

Hello there üëã welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a Software Developer from France.

I've been using a computer since I was a kid, playing video games that marked my childhood, such as Rayman, Dofus, World of Tanks, etc. However, I really started getting into computers in 2018. While playing Minecraft on a small French server, I said to myself, "What if I started creating content with code too?"

So I started coding in the Java language to make silly plugins for Minecraft. Over time, I ended up making my own server. It worked pretty well! But I wanted to discover new things. So, at the end of 2021, putting an end to my career in mechanics and other manual trades, I started training as a web developer to take my first step into the industry. Two years passed, during which I learned PHP, Javascript, ReactJS, Symfony, etc. I passed my diploma and graduated with a focus on backend development. I have serious shortcomings on the frontend (even today).

These days, I'm working in a small company on a remote reality car racing game. The experience is worthwhile, and I've learned a lot.

My plan for the future is to go freelance. I have a strong desire for freedom, and being able to earn my own living is my greatest wish.
